# Beyond-Meat-Brand-Consultation

Beyond Meat is a Los Angeles-based producer of plant-based meat substitutes founded in 2009. The company's initial products became available across the United States in 2012. The company has products designed to simulate chicken, beef, and pork sausage.

Setting ourselves as brand consultants for "Beyond Meat", we ventured into measuring perception difference if any for their products with respect to both general public and customer base. Also evaluated how Beyond Meat fared comapred to their competitors in the vegan meat market in terms of public opinion.
